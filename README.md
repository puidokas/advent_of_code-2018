# Advent of Code 2018

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other." - [AOC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about)

These are my solutions to the problems presented in Advent of Code 2018. The solutions were developed in C#.
